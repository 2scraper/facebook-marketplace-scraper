"""output_writer.py — the row model, JSON/CSV writer, dedupe, exit codes,
and run metadata. Carries (almost) no site knowledge: everything here is
part of the family's shared output CONTRACT — diverging from it needs a
written reason, not a per-site tweak. Ported near-verbatim from
lidl-scraper's output_writer.py (CLAUDE.md §7: porting starts by copying
the family-shared modules from the newest sibling and diffing what
changed on purpose) — in turn ported from skyscanner-scraper's, in turn
from stockx-scraper's original (commit 00b5570). The exit codes,
STATUS_BY_EXIT map, and finish_run() outcome-precedence logic are
IDENTICAL to every prior family member on purpose, including the fix
from a 2026-09-15 audit that found `blocked`/`remote_api_error` were
being silently ignored whenever products were present or --allow-empty
was passed. Only the `Product` dataclass's site-specific tail (below the
family-common fields) differs per repo.

    """Family-common fields first (identical name AND order to every other
    2scraper repo's row, in both JSON and CSV) so `diff_runs.py` and any
    other cross-repo tool keep working unmodified; Marketplace fields at
    the end.

    One row is one Marketplace LISTING, as a logged-out visitor sees it.
    What the commerce fields mean here:

    - `sku`: `facebook-listing-{listing_id}`; `category`: always "listing";
      `title`: the listing's title; `brand`: not shown, always None.
    - `price`: the asking price as a number (0.0 for a free item);
      `currency`: an ISO code — from an UNAMBIGUOUS symbol in the
      displayed price (£ → GBP, € → EUR) or, with `--details`, from the
      listing's own page. "$" alone is left None: the search does not say
      which dollar. `price_source`: "search" or "item_page".
    - `product_url`: the listing's own page; `image_url`: its main photo.

    Marketplace tail (see listing_parser.py for where each comes from):

    - `listing_id`, `price_text` (as displayed, "$110"), `original_price`
      (a struck-out earlier price), `city`, `state`, `location_text`,
      `listed_at` (UTC), `is_sold`, `is_pending`, `status`, `category_id`,
      `subtitle` (on vehicles, e.g. "73K miles"), `delivery_types_json`.
    - with `--details` (one more page per listing): `description`,
      `category_name`, `category_slug`, `condition`, `attributes_json`,
      `photo_urls_json`, `shipping_offered`, and the currency code.
    - `search_url` (the search the row came from) and `position` (its
      place in that search, from 1, across its pagination).

    Nothing about the SELLER — sometimes sent to a logged-out visitor,
    always a private person's name; this tool never writes it.
